Final project for MCON 275: Advanced Web Tools & Web Page Design.<br>
Authors: Gedalia Rabinowitz & Yisroel Lownthal<br>

Main Goals:<br>
Create a 5-10 page web site on a topic of your choice, using the skills learned in this course. (While the site will be somewhat limited, since we only covered client-side programming and not database connections, it will give you some “real-world” experience beyond the textbook assignments.)

The title of the website will be Building Pavilion - Home Self-Customization<br>
  Or maybe Building Pavilion – DIY Home Improvement. (We’re still working on the name…)<br>
The URL will be buildingpavilion.com<br>
This website will be an informative source of DIY home improvement projects and advice. Projects can include small finishing jobs such as moldings or painting, rewiring electrical outlets, common plumbing issues, etc. Other website features could be a paint calculator for calculating how much paint you need, or other such material calculators. Additionally, there will page for signing up to be alerted about updates.<br>
This website will be designed to help the average homeowner customize his home. The website will offer basic tutorials as well as tips for the more advanced builder.<br>
